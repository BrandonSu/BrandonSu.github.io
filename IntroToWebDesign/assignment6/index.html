			From <a href="http://pokemonhype.com/2016/04/20/charizard-popular-pokemon/" target="_blank"> source </a>:The Charizard Pokemon was created by Ken Sugimori in 1996, in Japan known as “Lizardon”. Charizard was one of the very first original pokemon mascots besides Blastoise of the gameboy; red and blue version, when the first games came out as pocket monsters. When they first created Charizard, it was one of the few choices brought by game freak’s development team to be put on gameboy front cover. Deciding it’s characters name to be more attractive for the western culture such as Untied States. Charizard character name comes from combination of Charcoal (Char) and Lizard (Zard) as a result Char*i*Zard.</p>
			<p>
			Sugimori took the approach of using a European dragon look for Charizard. Even though Charizard has a appearance of a Dragon but he is a fire & flying type lizard. Over the years Charizard getting many jokes of not being a Dragon, game freak finally fixed it by giving Charizard the “Mega-Charizard” evolution giving Charizard a dragon form.</p>

		My personal opinion:
		   Charizard is the best!!!! It has one of the coolest designs ever, like a chubby fire dragon hello?? It can melt boulders with its fire and can fly at speeds of fast things. It can also mega evolve now! Meaning it can either turn into this sick ass blue and black fire dragon with blue flames, or it can evolve into my personal favorite, the majestic af mega dragon looking thing! Also it's shiny colors look really cool.
