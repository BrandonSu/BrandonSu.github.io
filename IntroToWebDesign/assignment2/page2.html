<h1> My most mildly inconvenient first world problems and why</h1>
<p><img src="sad.jpg" /></p>

<ol>
<li><h2> Wearing pants that are too tight so when you sit down it like kinda hurts your legs but you have to tough it out because fasion is pain </h2>
<p> the daily struggle of being an ADULT </p> </li>

<li>
<h2> When I try to trick the Chipotle workers into not charging me extra for guac but they don't forget to charge me</h2>
<h2> Subproblem- when I ask them for a tortilla on the side and because I caused them inconvenience they give me smaller portions</h3>
<p> I'm cheap but also really like guacamole D: </p></li>

<li>
<h2> When it's cold outside and I'm holding my $600 phone that my parents bought for me and I'm wearing my winter jacket and warm clothes but my fingers get cold from playing Pokemon Go using a data plan that I also don't pay for</h2>
<p> winter is coming and the Starks are nowhere to be found </p></li>

<li>
<h2> And lastly, of course, when I'm coding on a $1000+ laptop (that I actually did buy myself lol) using energy that is most likely paid by someone else and I encounter any kind of bug after coding something for the first time :( </h2>
